# washing-machine-basic-functionality
This Verilog module models a washing machine using a finite state machine (FSM) with six states: Lock, Fill Water, Add Detergent, Cycle Running, Draining, and Spinning. It processes inputs like `start`, `door`, and `filled` to control outputs such as `lock`, `motor`, and `done`, simulating a washing machine's sequential operations.
